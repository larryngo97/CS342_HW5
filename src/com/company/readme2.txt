==========================GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS AND WORK PROGRESS=================

The project can successfully read in files but will
need user to type "end" to break out of the loop in making the questions...
(See examData.txt)


When answering MCMAQuestions... user must type all the letters one at a time
then enter in a space/newline in order to get out of answering the question.
Ex:
A
B
C
(space here) <-- continues onto next question

Use the examData.txt to read in the test (that gives a good idea on how to structure it)

Things that don't work:
- restoring student answers (it can take in a file name but does not correlate well)
- making a new exam after the first

CommandLine arguement wanted for the answers file. The Exam file will be found
from that, assuming the first line of the answers file is the name of the exam
file.

Also, the answer file is assumed to finish with only the word end. See example
student data file at the bottom
